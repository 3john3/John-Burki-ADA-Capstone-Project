# John-Burki-ADA-Capstone-Project

This repository includes the files for the ADA Capstone Project Submission for Semester Spring 2024. 
It includes all the codes used to create the models as well as the code to predict the outcome. 
Finally, I have also uploaded the three final model that have already been trained. These are the models
I created and saved to use later for the fruit and vegetable predictions. 
I have also included them in the Share point submission as they were to big for github.
The presentation recording and the paper are uploaded on the share point with the dataset.
